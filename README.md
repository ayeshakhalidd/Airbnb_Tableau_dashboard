# Airbnb Data Analysis Dashboard

## Description

This project is an interactive data analysis dashboard built to explore Airbnb listings across various regions. The aim is to provide insights into key metrics such as pricing per bedroom, geographic pricing distribution, and revenue trends over time. The analysis leverages Excel for data cleaning and transformation, then Tableau to create dynamic visualizations that help users identify market trends and opportunities.

## Raw Material

The project uses a raw dataset derived from public Airbnb listings. The raw material includes details such as:
- Listing IDs and titles  ![Screenshot 2025-04-15 184145](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5fbfae3a-f3fb-40cd-8739-c8b7f88ed65e)

- Number of bedrooms  
- Price per night  
- Zip code and location information  
- Booking and revenue figures

Before visualization, the data was imported into Excel where it was cleaned, standardized, and pre-processed. This ensured that inconsistencies were removed and the dataset was reliable for further analysis.
